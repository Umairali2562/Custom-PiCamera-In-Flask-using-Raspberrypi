I Created this Program for My Final year project , we had to have a Custom Camera by which we can take images by clicking the capture button.
so this script uses picamera and captures the image then redirects back to live streaming.


step 1: extract all files
step 2: start xampp and paste the index.php from localhost there.
step 3: run ok.py with flask by typing python3 ok.py in the terminal of linux  
step 4: visit using localhost you will see the live stream with the capture button , when you click the capture button it will capture and image and save the file in the path defined in the script
